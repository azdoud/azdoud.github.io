Back in 2009, first year of Masters in Ecole Normale Superieure,  I conducted preliminary research on non-destructive method for the analysis of damage. My collegue Julie Gimenez and I came up with this idea that diffuse damage could modify the thermal conductivity of composite material, and decided to evaluate this effect through a quick and simple 2D finite difference scheme implemented on Matlab. With simple assumptions on the conductivity of the cracked matrix fiber interface, we managed to identify a non-negligible change due to damage. Here you can find a link to a [presentation](https://azdoud.github.io/pdf/thermal.pdf) about this work, with all the skill and english fluency I could munster at the time.
