When I was in undergrad in ENS of Cachan, we had to participate in an industrial group project. The projects that cought my interest was the [Shell eco-marathon](http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/shell-ecomarathon.html) car, the concrete professional speakers and the man powered zepplin. Due to the large popularity of the first two, I got to work on the zepplin project. However, the concrete speaker concept spiked my interest and stayed with me until few months ago when I decided to start that project as a teaching course at the [Station North tool library](http://www.stationnorthtoollibrary.org/). The rationale behind concrete speaker is that concrete has very good acoustic property for enclosure design in the sens that the enclosure does not vibrate, and therfore do not create distortions by behaving as a sound source. <img src="https://azdoud.github.io/images/speaker.jpg" width="280" style="float:right; margin: 1em 0 4em 2em;"

I went to see John and Chris at the tool library with that idea and they where very excited. Chris, David and I quickly designed an appropriate prototype and after few month our first course was ready for a small wireless speaker. The [course](http://www.stationnorthtoollibrary.org/classes) is given every two months for up to 6 students on a two times 3 hour time frame. beside teaching the student about concrete modling and wood working with David and Chris, I also give an introductory lecture on speaker acoustic design. Come and register for the next class!
