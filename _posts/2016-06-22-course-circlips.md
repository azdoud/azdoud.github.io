My actual first publication is not exactly a journal paper, but a [course on circlips](http://eduscol.education.fr/sti/si-ens-cachan/ressources_pedagogiques/simulation-des-deformations-dun-circlips-par-la-rdm) which I published on the online ressources of the French Ministery of Education. Circlips are metalic ring designed to fit on axles to lock component together axially. One important feature is that the circlips should fit snuggly all around the circonference of the axle, with a good tolerance for the possible inaccuracies in the diameter of the axle. This course focuses on an application of the moment method in beam theroy to predict an accurate shape for the circlips such that the circlip remains circular even with application of a force to open it. I invite you to parse through the [pdf](http://eduscol.education.fr/sti/sites/eduscol.education.fr.sti/files/ressources/pedagogiques/5586/5586-simulation-des-deformations-dun-circlips-par-la-rdm-ens.pdf) if your interested by the formulation, since the ressource is in French.
