When I arrived in Baltimore, I got involved in the maker space the [Station North Tool Library](http://www.stationnorthtoollibrary.org/). The guys and girls at the Tool library will lend you tool and knowhow for a modest yearly contribution, which is a great ressource for DIYer on a budget. On top of lending tools, they also offer courses for different makers projects and skills, in particular, a very popular knife class. After talking mettalurgy with John, co-founder of the Tool library, I got the opportunity to help out and give an introduction course to mettalurgy to the apprentice knife makers, and to enjoy making one knife myself. I attached my presentation slides to this post, check it out!
