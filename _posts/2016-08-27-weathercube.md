Few months ago, Anna and Chris invited me to work on a project related to Anna's PhD research on weather measurment in urban environment. She already conducted succesful field campaigns to gather temperature data with button-like temperature sensors. The problem of this technology was the relatively high cost of the sensor and the logistic problems associated with data gathering. Each end of summer, Anna had to gather back all the sensors to extract the data, recharge the battery and analyse the data. This was expensive, inefficient and the possibility of loosing data a real threat. Therefore, the need for a low cost, real-time, autonomous and accurate sensing method was critical.

Here comes Chris and me to engineer the hell of this.
Chris designs low cost sensor for field application in poor countries using open hardware, and I have training in structural and industrial design. Together with Anna we imagined a solution for a low cost weather station that would respect meterological standard but could be deployed in urban area. My task in this work was limited in designing a glorified box that we call the weathercube. Few weeks ago, Anna pushed for external funds and published a crowdfunding campaign through the website "experiment". Amazingly, after a week online, we managed to get the required fund for this project! check out the [project](https://experiment.com/projects/how-do-parks-cool-baltimore)!
